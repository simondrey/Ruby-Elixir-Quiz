# Ruby-Elixir-Quiz
Ruby and Elixir solutions for some of the problems defined in http://rubyquiz.com and other places like codekata.com etc. My goals are:
- to compare Elixir (functional language) and Ruby (object language)
- to find interesting solutions based on strengths of Elixir and Ruby
- to make Ruby scripts as short as possible but in style of Elixir
- to make Elixir code more similar to Ruby
- to have fun with programming.

**NOTE** This code is ugly - not for production etc.
